  <p>Retro/vintage Cars are, in the most general sense, an old automobile, and in the narrower senses of car enthusiasts and collectors, it is a car from the period of 1919 to 1930.

  <h1>The Nissan Figaro</h1>
  <p>
    The Nissan Figaro was a limited-production, high visibility “halo” car, intended solely for the Japanese market.  Based on existing Nissan Micra mechanicals, the “retro styling car” was intended to provide “delicate elegance” and “trendy sophistication” with a sense of ‘60s retro styling, “satisfying a zestful desire for a good time.”  It was first shown at the 1989 Tokyo Motor show.  The name comes from Mozart’s comic opera “The Marriage of Figaro.”  The Figaro proved to be so popular that the original run of 8,000 vehicles was increased to a total of 20,000.  Potential buyers had to enter a lottery in order to purchase a car; winners were then notified if their car would be produced in March (8,000 cars), June (6,000), or August (6,000).  Wildly popular in their intended market, they also became quite a commodity on the used-car market, with many Figaros finding their way to the UK, another RHD market. The roofline and folding top of the Figaro mimics some 1950’s Italian cars particularly the Autobianchina Transformabile and the Vespa 400.

  <h1>Ford Mustang</h1>
  <p>

    Teri Garcia owns this Dusk Rose pink, 1967, 200 Sprint, Mustang hardtop which was our Attitude Of The Week for the week starting January 31st, 2010. Teri tells us more: My Mom and Dad bought me my 1967 Mustang in 1995 (my senior year of high school). When I got my Mustang it was Red. It is a 6-cylinder 200 sport sprint with a 3 speed on the floor. We did not know what we had until my brother went to put a new stereo in the car and saw the floor boards were pink. We ran the codes and sure enough it was originally Dusk Rose. My brother really had to twist my arm to restore it back to the original color. I always wanted a red Mustang. In 2002, I finally had it restore back to it's original color. It was done just in time for my wedding. In 2007 we had the engine rebuilt, engine compartment redone, and a good bit of the suspension redone. Restoring this Mustang back to the original color was the best thing we ever did. People are so curious about it. We have so much fun meeting and talking to people about our Mustang. We have won many awards. We have two 2nd place awards and one 3rd place from the All Ford Nationals in Carlisle, Pennsylvania.

      <h1>Volkswagen Beetle 1200</h1>
      <p>
        Volkswagen Beetle 1200 from 1982. Nice striking classic! Completely in the American-style. It has the thicker bumpers with suspension, larger indicators on the front fenders and a lot more! The 1200 cc engine drives very well. Technically, the vehicle still has a Dutch Periodic Vehicle Inspection valid until 19-02-2019. Its interior is fitted with black imitation leather and looks good. A lot of documentation/history available! From this documentation it is clear that in the last 20 years it drove less than 2,500 km per year. Always used as a 2nd car, which has really spared this Beetle. Of course with signs of wear throughout, but definitely a very nice classic! This vehicle can be viewed and picked up in Schijndel, the Netherlands.

  <h1>Mercedes-Benz 300 SL </h1>
  <p>
    The Mercedes-Benz 300 SL (chassis code W 198) is a two-seat sports car which was produced by Mercedes-Benz as a gullwinged coupe (1954–1957) and roadster (1957–1963).[2] It was based on the company's 1952 racer, the W194, with mechanical direct fuel injection which boosted power almost 50 percent in its three-liter overhead camshaft straight-six engine.[3] Capable of reaching a top speed of up to 263 km/h (163 mph), it was a sports car racing champion[4] and the fastest production car of its time.[3]
    Max Hoffman, Mercedes-Benz's United States importer at the time, inspired the 300 SL and saw an American market for such a car. The company introduced the 300 SL in February 1954 at the International Motor Sports Show in New York City (instead of Europe) to get it into U.S. buyers' hands sooner.
    SL is the short form for "super-light" in German (super-leicht)[5] – Mercedes' first use of the designation, referring to the car's racing-bred light tubular-frame construction. The 300 SL was voted the "sports car of the century" in 1999.[6]

  <h1>The Nissan 180SX😍</h1>
  <p>
    The Nissan 180SX is a fastback automobile that was produced by Nissan Motors between 1988 and 1998. It is based on the S13 chassis from the Nissan S platform with the variants receiving an R designation (ex. PS13 and RPS13), and was sold exclusively in Japan paired with the CA18 motor in the early models; later models paired with the SR20 motor. Outside of Japan, it was re-badged as the 200SX[1] and in the US market as the Nissan 240SX, paired with the single overhead cam KA24E motor and later with the dual-overhead model KA24DE. The 180SX was built and sold by Nissan as a sister model to the Nissan Silvia from model year 1989 through 1998, but sold at two different Japanese Nissan dealerships. The Silvia was sold at Nissan Prince Store, and the 180SX was sold at Nissan Bluebird Store locations. In Japan, the 180SX replaced the Gazelle. The S13 Silvia was discontinued in 1993, but the 180SX was successful enough to convince Nissan to keep it in the market for the full length of the next generation Silvia (S14). The 180SX differed from the S13 Silvia in that it featured pop-up headlights and a liftgate with different body work at the rear of the vehicle. Specifications and equipment were similar; however, the naturally aspirated CA18DE engine was not offered.[2]
    The name 180SX was originally in reference to the 1.8 liter displacement CA18DET engine used in the chassis. In 1991, however, the engine was upgraded to a 2.0 liter model, offered in two forms: the turbocharged SR20DET variant and the naturally aspirated SR20DE engine, which was introduced in 1996. Although the new engine was of larger displacement, the 180SX nomenclature remained.
    180SX was also a trim level of the S110 Silvia in Europe. The badges for this model read "Silvia 180SX", so this car is not properly a 180SX by model, but a version of the Silvia instead.

  <h1>Bmw 2001</h1>
  <p>
    In typical BMW fashion, the 3 Series lineup is being introduced in stages. The first models to change were the sedans, followed by the coupes, the convertible, and the wagon. This allows BMW to maintain customer interest in their best-selling platform over the course of several years.
    Sedan buyers can choose from an upgraded 2.5-liter inline six (models with this powerplant will now use the numerical designation of 325) that now makes 184 horsepower, or a new-for-2001 3.0-liter inline six (330 models). The latter engine, which debuted in the X5 3.0i, replaces the 2.8-liter engine across BMW's entire product line. Bumping horsepower and torque from the former engine's 193 and 206, respectively, to 225 and 214 in the 3.0-liter adds some noticeable punch to the 3 Series and helps keep it ahead of rivals like the Audi A4 and new Lexus IS 300.
    Riding on the same platform, the 3 Series sedans, coupes and convertible receive a standard five-speed manual transmission, a sport-tuned suspension, and ventilated front and rear disc brakes. Two versions of the coupe are available: the 325Ci, with the aforementioned 2.5-liter inline six, and the 330Ci with the more powerful 3.0-liter engine, larger brakes and standard 17-inch wheels. The more powerful 330 coupe reaches 60 from zero in just 6.4 seconds and features a broad torque band. Both engines meet low-emission vehicle (LEV) standards. A five-speed Steptronic automanual transmission is available for those who don't want to shift their own gears.
    Another new option for 2001 is all-wheel drive. Derived from the all-wheel-drive system found in the X5, "xi" models split 38 percent of the engine's power to the front wheels and 62 percent to the rear. The AWD package also includes a 0.7-inch increase in ride height and is available on both 325 and 330 sedans as well as the 325 wagon.

      <h1>The Porsche 944</h1>
      <p>
        The Porsche 944 is a sports car manufactured by German automobile manufacturer Porsche from 1982 until 1991. A front-engine, rear-wheel drive mid-level model based on the 924 platform, the 944 was available in coupé or cabriolet body styles, with either naturally aspirated or turbocharged engines. With over 163,000 cars produced, the 944 was the most successful sports car in Porsche's history until the introductions of the Boxster and 997 Carrera.
        Extensive design revisions for the 1992 model year prompted Porsche to drop the 944 nameplate and rebrand the vehicle as the 968.
        The 924 had originally been a project of VW-Porsche, a joint Porsche/Volkswagen company incorporated to develop and produce the 914 which was sold in Europe badged as both a Porsche and a Volkswagen. In 1972, a replacement for the Volkswagen version of the 914, code named EA-425 began development. The model was to be sold as an Audi as part of the VW-Audi-Porsche marketing arrangement. Porsche was to manufacture its own version of the car.[1] At one point, Volkswagen head Rudolf Leidig declared the EX-425 was going to be a Volkswagen exclusively, thus denying Porsche's version of the 914's replacement. Although testing had begun in the Spring of 1974, Volkswagen cancelled the EX-425 program, the reason being significant financial losses due to declining sales and rising development costs for new vehicles as well as the departure of Leidig. The recently introduced Volkswagen Scirocco was expected to fill the sports coupé market segment and the unfinished project was handed over to Audi to serve as the replacement for the Audi 100.[2]
        The cancellation of the EX-425 program led Porsche to market an entry level car to replace the 912E, which was a US-only stop-gap model for 1976, and their version of the 914, which was

      <h1>Renault 4CV -1946 </h1>
      <p>
        The engine is liquid-cooled, with four cylinders in line. It is also characterised by its three main bearing design and its piston stroke of 80 mm (3.15 in). It has a cast-iron block, aluminium cylinder head and uses a lateral camshaft to operate overhead valves, which also operated the fan belt on its other end. In June 1940, Louis Renault appointed Fernand Picard who became deputy technical director in the automobile engine department. During the World War II, he participated in the study of a small car: the future 4CV. Its engine was ready in 1942 and a year later, it first turned a wheel. Renault replaced this engine with the Cléon-Fonte engine, a completely new design.[1]
        This engine designed by Fernand Picard was produced from 1947 to 1985, in displacements of 0.6 L (603 cc), 0.7 L (748 cc), 0.8 L (782 cc), and 0.8 L (845 cc). These differences were carried out by changing the cylinder bore diameter[2]

  <h1>Roadmaster</h1>
  <p>
    The origins of the Roadmaster name date to 1936 when Buick added names to its entire model lineup to celebrate the engineering improvements and design advancements over their 1935 models. Buick's Series 40 was named the Special, the Series 50 became the Super, the Series 60 was named the Century and the Series 90 — Buick's largest and most luxurious vehicle — was named the Limited. The Series 50 was retired, but new for the model year was the Series 80 Roadmaster. The 1936 Buick sales brochure describes "It literally named itself the first time a test model leveled out on the open highway." The terminology "Series 60" and "Series 70" were shared with Cadillac, while "Series 60", "Series 70", "Series 80", and "Series 90" were shared with Oldsmobile. The Roadmaster was introduced in a year when Buick's valve-in-head straight-eight engines were heavily revised. Buick reduced the number of engines from four sizes to two: a 233-cubic-inch, 93-horsepower job for the Special, and a 320.2-cubic inch, 120-horsepower engine for the other series. Buick also adopted an all-steel "turret top" and hydraulic brakes. Coil springs were in the front.[4]
    The Roadmaster sedan weighed 4,098 pounds, about 88 pounds more than Cadillac's new Series 60. The sedan sold for $1,255 ($23,406 in 2020 dollars [2]), $440 ($8,206 in 2020 dollars [2]) less than the least expensive Cadillac. The only other body style was a four-door convertible phaeton, priced at $1,565 ($29,187 in 2020 dollars [2]) (a total of 1,064 were produced), at a time when a Cadillac in the same body style sold was priced from $2,745 ($51,194 in 2020 dollars [2]). Buick sales went from just over 48,000 to nearly 158,000 and with the new Series 80 Roadmaster contributing 16,049 units to that total.[1]

  <h1>The Alfa Romeo Spider</h1>
  <p>
    The Alfa Romeo Spider (105/115 series) is a two-seater, front engine, rear drive roadster manufactured and marketed by Alfa Romeo from 1966 to 1994 in four distinct generations, or Series, each with modifications ranging from modest to extensive.[3]
    As successor to the Giulia Spider, the Spider remained in production for almost three decades. The first three Series were assembled by Pininfarina in Grugliasco and the fourth Series in San Giorgio Canavese. The last Spider of that series was manufactured in April 1993 — the last rear wheel drive Alfa Romeo before the Alfa Romeo 8C Competizione of 2007. However, the sixth generation Alfa Spider (Type 939) was also designed by Pininfarina and produced between 2006 to 2010. In 2012, FCA Italy and Mazda studied the possibility of jointly developing a new Spider for 2015 based on the Mazda MX-5 platform.[4] Ultimately, FCA and Mazda chose to manufacture a modern interpretation of the Fiat 124 Sport Spider rather than reviving the Alfa Romeo Spider
